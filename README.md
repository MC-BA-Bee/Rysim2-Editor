## Introduction 简介
我们为Rysim2准备了专门的写谱程序，但Rysim2 Editor只兼容Rysim2的谱面文件，旧版Rysim请使用内置的写谱工具

## Summary 概况
使用Rysim2 Editor来编辑与完善谱面！


## Features
我们将在每个版本的发布页面提供Python源文件以及打包成exe的文件

## Requirements
### After v4.5:
We use .exe to run our program.   
(But perhaps thev.py version will run faster)

## Installation
After v4.5, you don't need to do more things for your computer, you just need to download and unzipped it!  
Before v4.42 you need installed [Python](python.org) and Pygame and Pgzero libraries.
